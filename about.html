            <p>
                Hello! I'm Riana Lim. I am a 4th year Computer Science student at the Ateneo de Manila University in the Philippines. 
                I am currently waiting to start my internship at Procter & Gamble in June 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a Computer Science student, I've been able to explore <b>web design and development</b> through my school projects, as well as 
                <b>data science and analytics</b> through the electives I've been able to take.
            </p>
            <p>
                Right now, I'm the <b>President of the Computer Society of the Ateneo</b>, and my favorite parts about the job are helping my members 
                & officers improve their leadership skills and witnessing their growth over the years. Before becoming president, I previously served 
                the organization as the Associate Vice President for Promotions, among other things. I'm also a <b>back-end developer</b> for the enlistment website 
                of Ateneo's alternative class program, Talakayang Alay sa Bayan.
            </p>
            <p>
                On top of my leadership duties, I am also a member of the <b>Ateneo Programming Varsity</b> where I undergo competitive programming training alongside 16 awesome people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before college, the most experience I had with coding was changing the theme of my Tumblr blog, so I struggled during the first semester of my freshman year. Even though I wasn't the best programmer, I became curious about Ateneo's 
                Programming Varsity, and I learned to appreciate programming as I gradually solved the 100 competitive programming problems I needed to get in the team. 
                Competitive programming showed me that the ability to solve problems through code took a lot of creativity, cooperation, 
                and perseverance. I think that competitive programming is like a microcosm of the tech industry. There's a problem 
                we're all trying to solve, and that's why we code. This is why I want programming to become more accesible to the Filipino youth. I've found 
                programming to be really empowering because it has allowed me to solve problems and make cool things happen, and I wish I learned it sooner.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not busy with school work, meetings, or programming, I am usually drawing, playing video games, window shopping for keycaps, or watching anime.
            </p>
